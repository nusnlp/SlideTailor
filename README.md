This repository contains the official implementation of the AAAI 2026 paper "SlideTailor: Personalized Presentation Slide Generation for Scientific Papers".


## 🔆 Highlights 

- **Task:** We introduce a novel task that conditions paper-to-slides generation on user-specified preferences.
- **System:** We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner.
- **Evaluation:** We construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with meticulously designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation.
- **Open Source:** We will release the source code and data to the community.
