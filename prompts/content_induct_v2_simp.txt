You are given two JSON objects: con_scheme and details.

Your task is to generate a new JSON object (updated content_schema) by matching the keys in con_scheme to the most relevant shapes in details. For each key in con_scheme, find the most relevant shape in details (mainly based on content similarity, such as matching text). Then, add the shape's pptc_size_info and pptc_space_info (and other useful shape info if needed) into the corresponding entry in con_scheme, and output the merged result as a new content_schema.

Rules:
1. For each key in con_scheme (e.g., "main_title", "presenters"), find the most relevant shape in details (mainly based on content similarity, such as matching text).
2. For each matched key, add the following fields from the shape in details to the corresponding entry in con_scheme:
    - pptc_size_info
    - pptc_space_info
    (You may also add other useful fields from the shape if needed.)
3. The final output should be a new JSON object, where:
    - Keys are from con_scheme
    - Values are the original content from con_scheme, with the additional fields from the matched shape in details
4. If a key in con_scheme cannot find a matching shape in details, just keep the original content for that key.
5. Only output the resulting JSON, with no extra explanation.

Example Input:

con_scheme:
{
  "main_title": {
    "description": "The primary title that summarizes the presentation or slide's topic",
    "type": "text",
    "data": [
      "Presentation Title is Presentation Title is Presentation Title"
    ]
  },
  "presenters": {
    "description": "A list of the individuals responsible for creating or presenting the slide",
    "type": "text",
    "data": [
      "Presenter: Presenter 1, Presenter 2, Presenter 3, Presenter 1, Presenter 2, Presenter 3"
    ]
  }
}

details:
{
  "shape_0": {
    "pptc_description": "[TextBox id=0]\n",
    "pptc_size_info": "Size: height=96pt, width=347pt\n",
    "pptc_space_info": "Visual Positions: left=47pt, top=324pt\n",
    "pptc_text_info": "Presenter: Presenter 1, Presenter 2, Presenter 3, Presenter 1, Presenter 2, Presenter 3",
    "shape_idx": 0
  },
  "shape_1": {
    "pptc_description": "[FreeShape id=1]\n",
    "pptc_size_info": "Size: height=87pt, width=3pt\n",
    "pptc_space_info": "Visual Positions: left=36pt, top=169pt\n",
    "pptc_text_info": "[Text id=1]\n",
    "shape_idx": 1
  },
  "shape_2": {
    "pptc_description": "[TextBox id=2]\n",
    "pptc_size_info": "Size: height=152pt, width=402pt\n",
    "pptc_space_info": "Visual Positions: left=39pt, top=142pt\n",
    "pptc_text_info": "Presentation Title is Presentation Title is Presentation Title\n",
    "shape_idx": 2
  }
}

Example Output:

{
  "main_title": {
    "description": "The primary title that summarizes the presentation or slide's topic",
    "type": "text",
    "data": [
      "Presentation Title is Presentation Title is Presentation Title"
    ],
    "pptc_size_info": "Size: height=152pt, width=402pt\n",
    "pptc_space_info": "Visual Positions: left=39pt, top=142pt\n"
  },
  "presenters": {
    "description": "A list of the individuals responsible for creating or presenting the slide",
    "type": "text",
    "data": [
      "Presenter: Presenter 1, Presenter 2, Presenter 3, Presenter 1, Presenter 2, Presenter 3"
    ],
    "pptc_size_info": "Size: height=96pt, width=347pt\n",
    "pptc_space_info": "Visual Positions: left=47pt, top=324pt\n"
  }
}

Only output the resulting JSON. Do not include any explanations or extra text.

Actual Input:
<Con_scheme begin>
{{con_scheme}}
<Con_scheme end>

<Details begin>
{{details}}
<Details end>
